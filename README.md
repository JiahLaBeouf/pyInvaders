Welcome to PyInvaders, the pygame project inspired by the legendary space invaders game! In this game, players select their ship to destroy the aliens in an attempt to save their home base! The Aliens will fight hard however, advancing across and down the screen, dropping bombs as they go. Your mission is to survive as long as you can without losing all your lives or allowing your space base to be destroyed!
